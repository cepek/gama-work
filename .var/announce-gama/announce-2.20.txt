About

GNU Gama package is dedicated to adjustment of geodetic networks. It
is intended for use with traditional geodetic surveyings which are
still used and needed in special measurements (e.g., underground or
high precision engineering measurements) where the Global Positioning
System (GPS) cannot be used.

Adjustment in local coordinate systems is fully supported by a
command-line program gama-local that adjusts geodetic (free) networks
of observed distances, directions, angles, height differences, 3D
vectors and observed coordinates (coordinates with given
variance-covariance matrix). Adjustment in global coordinate systems
is supported only partly as a gama-g3 program.

The SHA256 checksum is base64 encoded, instead of the
hexadecimal encoding that most checksum tools default to.

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

  gpg --verify gama-2.20.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
or that public key has expired, try the following commands to update
or refresh it, and then rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

Changes in release 2.20 (2022-06-30)

  - The new algorithm ICGS (iterated classical Gram-Schmidt) in the
    class AdjGSO replaced the former algorithm MGS (modified
    Gram-Schmidt), which was implemented with column pivoting as a
    template class GSO. The template class GSO is meant only as a tool
    for testing purposes. Both initial scaling and pivoting with
    euclidean norms are not suitable for practical computations.

    The old legacy code with MGS used in the AdjGSO class is still
    available with conditional compilation directive statements if the
    name GNU_GAMA_GSO_LEGACY_CODE is defined.
